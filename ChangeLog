* Added code to call an overriden virtual method. Not working yet, not sure how
to tell if the method has been overriden or not.
* Added some debugging enum values to control debugging areas, and switch 
debugging on

* Added a global hash to map C++ pointers onto the corresponding QScriptValues

* Added some more marshallers, now complete all primitve types and strings.
* Timed startup with creating 500 'StaticClass' classes, and found the time
taken to be negligable. Left the code in qtscript-smoke.cpp commented out, so
that Ian can try.

* Add virtual method call marshallers
* Began some implementation of the marshalling code for QScript to the Smoke
stack

* Added a marshalling framework based on the PerlQt design. It doesn't work
yet though.
* Added a ChangeLog to the project, now it seems to be a bit more than a 
prototype
